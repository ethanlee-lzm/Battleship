## Improvements for the future

There a few aspects of this project that can be improved upon in the future: 
- Developing better AI, that will change its behavior upon correctly guessing a 'hit' 
- Recognizing when a ship has sunk, and notifying the player 
- Better styling in the setup menu, highlighting the grid cells when placing ships 

## Acknowledgement 

Design of this game is inspired by the classic game Battleship
